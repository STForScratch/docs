# Feedback Center

The ScratchTools Feedback Center is built into the ScratchTools extension and allows users to submit feedback and quickly receive responses back from developers.

## Accessing the Feedback Center
It's very easy to access the Feedback Center. There is a button in the bottom-left (bottom-right on smaller screens) that quickly takes you to the Feedback Center. After verification, you will be taken to the main page.

An input box is provided on the left, where the user may submit feedback to developers. On the right are the user's messages. These messages are sent by developers. If there are unread messages, a notification icon will display next to the button to the Feedback Center on the settings page.

## Submitting feedback
Once submitting feedback via the Feedback Center, developers are notified.
### Visible information
Feedback submitted via the extension includes multiple pieces of important information.
- User's username (from verification)
- Feedback
- User's ScratchTools version number
- User's useragent (includes info such as operating system and browser)
- The features they have enabled

:::info

ScratchTools Developers are prohibited from reaching out via the Scratch website specifically in response to feedback. **Feedback responses will only be via the ScratchTools settings page.**

### Bug reports
If a submission is a bug report, then it will be tested using the current version of ScratchTools. Valid bugs are submitted to ScratchTools' bug tracking team. Bugs submitted via feedback are generally fixed before the next update. Invalid bug reports are dropped.

### Suggestions
ScratchTools appreciates suggestions a lot. Many features in ScratchTools are suggested by users via feedback. Users who submit new feature suggestions have the option to receive credit within the extension itself.

## Developer responses
Once feedback has been evaluated, developers may respond to feedback. Their responses go through a few checks before being sent to users, but the checks should never take longer than a few hours. Once the responses go through, users may access them from their Feedback Center page.
