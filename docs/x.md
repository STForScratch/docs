# About ScratchToolsX
ScratchTools is very open about development on new features, and more active users generally know when new features are coming out, even before release videos and notes. However, there are circumstances when we don't want users to know about upcoming features until they are officially announced.

The purpose of this page is to describe what ScratchToolsX is used for and how it affects users, as well as the privacy precautions that we agree to.

## Examples
Generally, bigger features are part of ScratchToolsX. These are features that ScratchTools wants users to not know about until the release of a major version each year. This is purely to keep the new features as a surprise.

## Privacy
ScratchTools is open sourced, and so all code is viewable by anybody. This helps people to trust ScratchTools. There are a lot of browser extensions with malicious intentions, but ScratchTools isn't one of them and that can be seen clearly in the source code.

However, with ScratchToolsX, a lot of development happens outside of the main repository. Here are the reasons why you can trust us:
- Code sent to web stores only comes from the main repository- nothing reaches you directly from ScratchToolsX repositories
- You will have the opportunity to hear about any ScratchToolsX changes before they come to you, whether in articles or in release videos
- All currently active ScratchToolsX features will continue to follow the ScratchTools privacy policy that the rest of the extension follows
- All features go through the main repository as pull requests, just as all other features do

## Team
All work on ScratchToolsX projects is kept very confidential and isn't shared with anybody outside of any given project's specific developer team.

ScratchToolsX developers are very trusted individuals. If you are interested in joining the team, you may apply [here](https://forms.gle/c9ujj8SqxLgeTkR39).
