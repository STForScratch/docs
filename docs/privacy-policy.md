# Privacy policy
Privacy is very important to ScratchTools. Our goal when it comes to privacy is to provide the best features for you to use, while finding ways to do so that preserve your online privacy and safety.

:::noteImportant Reference

When this policy references the Scratch website, it is referencing scratch.mit.edu and all of its subdomains, including the API, CDN, and cloud data.

:::

## Overview

1. Important account tokens aren't stored or shared outside of the Scratch website. Project tokens are shared with the servers behind the TurboWarp Button and Unlisted Projects features to allow them to work properly.
2. We do not track who is using the extension. Web stores allow us to see how many users are using the extension, but we are unable to see who they are. We can't see how many people have specific features enabled. We **can** see how many users have ever used the Display Names, Online Statuses, and Emoji Statuses features.

## Feedback and support centers
The feedback center and support center allow us to view additional information when used. Here's what we can see/do:

### Feedback center
When you submit feedback, we can see:
- Your useragent (which browser and operating system).
- Your ScratchTools version.
- Your Scratch username (we may respond to you via the ScratchTools extension, not on your Scratch profile).
- Your enabled features (we can see what features you have enabled, but not specific options. *Example: we might know you have Custom Website Font enabled, but we don't know what font*).

Our support specialists and developers should never contact you in response to feedback via your Scratch profile. They have other ways of alerting you via the extension.

### Support center
When you open the support center, we can see:
- Your ScratchTools version.
- Your Scratch username (we may respond to you via the ScratchTools extension, not on your Scratch profile).
- Your enabled features (we can see what features you have enabled, but not specific options. *Example: we might know you have Custom Website Font enabled, but we don't know what font*).

Whenever you're in a support chat with our specialists, the specialists can:
- Disable all features and restore them.
- Reload the extension.
- Export your settings to your device.
- Update your features.

We trust our support specialists, but they can't take any action on your extension when a support chat page is closed or disconnected.

## Parties
Here are the sites that we fetch from, why we do so, and the conditions on which we do. We also fetch data from Scratch's CDN (where images are hosted), API (where important data is hosted), main site, and their cloud data server.
