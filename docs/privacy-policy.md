# Privacy Policy
Privacy is very important to ScratchTools. Our goal when it comes to privacy is to provide the best features for you to use, while finding ways to do so that preserve your online privacy and safety.

## Parties
Here are the sites that we fetch from, why we do so, and the conditions on which we do. We also fetch data from Scratch's CDN (where images are hosted), API (where important data is hosted), main site, and their cloud data server.
