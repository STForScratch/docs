# Localization
ScratchTools wants the extension to be used by lots of people, and part of that is making sure that everyone has the ability to understand it. ScratchTools works hard to translate the extension into many different languages, with the help of 100+ translators who speak a combined 30+ languages.

We update strings when new features are added, which is fairly often. It's never overwhelming, as it's usually just a few words every few days. Just be prepared to see changes to source files every once in a while.

Translators are eligible to be added to [our credits page](https://scratchtools.app/credits/).

:::infoAbout Dialects

As we begin translating the extension, please prioritize translating into main languages before specific dialects. For example, prioritize "pt" (Portuguese) before "pt_BR" (Portuguese in Brazil).

There are requirements for joining the localization team.

1. You must be fluent in all languages you apply for.
2. You must also be fluent in English. You will need to translate strings from English.
3. You must have an email address. If and when you get accepted, you'll receive an email there from Transifex.

## Getting Started
If you know are fluent in both English and at least one other language, you can join the localization team on Transifex. You can find the public page on Transifex [here](https://explore.transifex.com/scratchtools/scratchtools/). Click the "Join This Project" button to apply.

We review new applications at least once every 24 hours, and you'll receive an email once we accept you. Feel free to ask us if you have any questions by opening an issue [on our Github](https://github.com/STForScratch/ScratchTools/).

## Localization for developers
- [Setting up localization files for features](https://docs.scratchtools.app/docs/api/msg#setting-localization-in-data-file)
- [Using translated strings in userscripts](https://docs.scratchtools.app/docs/api/msg)

Developers should **only** update strings in English. Feature localization files are automatically updated within the repository daily, and are manually updated in other languages by the localization team.
