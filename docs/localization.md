# Localization
ScratchTools wants the extension to be used by lots of people, and part of that is making sure that everyone has the ability to understand it. ScratchTools works hard to translate the extension into many different languages, with the help of 100+ translators who speak a combined 30+ languages.

If you know a language, we'd appreciate your help translating. Please help us translate by [joining our Transifex project](https://explore.transifex.com/scratchtools/scratchtools/).

We review new users at least once every 24 hours, and you'll receive an email once we accept you. Feel free to ask us if you have any questions by opening an issue [on our Github](https://github.com/STForScratch/ScratchTools/).

We update strings when new features are added, which is fairly often. It's never overwhelming, as it's usually just a few words every few days. Just be prepared to see changes to source files every once in a while.

Translators are eligible to be added to [our credits page](https://scratchtools.app/credits/).
