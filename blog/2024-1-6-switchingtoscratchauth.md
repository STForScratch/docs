ScratchTools previously used cloud variables to automatically verify users with the ScratchTools servers. However, ScratchTools has recently switched to Scratch Auth, instead.

## Why the change?
This change has come primarily because Scratch's cloud data servers are broken. You may notice this whenever you try to view cloud variable history for projects. This means that ScratchTools is unable to see which users are verifying, and therefore can't verify that a user is actually who they say they are.

Without the ability to verify, we couldn't protect ScratchTools. Verification made sure that users could only set their own display names and emoji statuses, or fill out feedback in the extension under their own username. It also affected many other parts of ScratchTools. Due to this, we had to disable multiple features, the in-extension feedback system, and the support center chat.

In addition to this, the Scratch Team does not show any interest in fixing the issue. It has been reported numerous times on the Scratch website community, as well as the forums. While there have been responses to the reports, nothing has been fixed. The issue has existed for months.

## What does this mean for me?
When verifying with ScratchTools, you will be redirected to Scratch Auth. Once verifying, you will be sent back to ScratchTools. Once you verify once with Scratch Auth, you can save your username. That way, you can log in with just the click of a button.

The entire process will take less than 5 seconds on average once you save your profile.

Here's when you would need to verify with Scratch Auth:
- Changing your display name
- Changing your emoji status
- Opening a support chat with the developer team
- Submitting feedback via the extension

## Changes to display names and emoji statuses
With these new changes, we've made it even easier for you to update your display name and emoji status. Instead of using a modal to update each one, we've made a dashboard where you can change both of them easily!

Changing your emoji status and display name is even easier now. It will also make it a lot easier when ScratchTools begins to add more profile customization features.
