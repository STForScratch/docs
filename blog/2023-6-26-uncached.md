To ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience, we implemented a caching system that temporarily stores project data on our secure servers. However, we recently encountered a challenge due to limited database space, which led us to make some necessary adjustments. Unfortunately, this meant that we had to remove all previously generated access links. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Rest assured, we have taken this opportunity to improve the system for an even better user experience moving forward.

With our latest enhancements, projects will now remain cached for a generous duration of 7 days. This extended caching period provides enough time for others to access, engage with, and appreciate your creative endeavors. Whether seeking feedback, collaboration, or simply sharing your coding with the Scratch community, the Unlisted Projects feature in ScratchTools has got you covered.

It's important to note that if a project gets cached again within the 7-day window, the caching timer will reset, ensuring that your projects remain accessible for an extended period. This way, you can continue to gather feedback, collaborate, and witness the impact of your creations within the vibrant Scratch ecosystem.
